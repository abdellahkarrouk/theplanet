      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the
      terrestrial planets. The Earth is the only planet in our solar system not
      to be named after a Greek or Roman deity. The Earth was formed
      approximately 4.54 billion years ago and is the only known planet to
      support life.

    <h2>Facts about the Earth</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Earthâ€™s rotation is gradually slowing. This deceleration is
        happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per
        hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly
        uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so
        slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length
        of a day will have increased to 25 hours.

        The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe. Due to the
        apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their
        viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted that the Earth remained static,
        whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it.
        Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was
        postulated by Copernicus, though this is also not the case

        Earth has a powerful magnetic field. This phenomenon is caused by the
        nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This
        field protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.
